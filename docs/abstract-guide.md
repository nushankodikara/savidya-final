Objectives: This article provides practical guidance on developing a comprehensible abstract, including those
required for funding applications, conferences, and publication. In addition, we discuss and demonstrate the
practicalities of editing and revising an abstract for conference or peer review and identify emerging formats
that may be more relevant to nurses and researchers.
Data Sources: This article has been informed by literature and the coauthors’ respective experiences of pre-
paring and reviewing abstracts for publication and conference presentation.
Conclusion: Abstracts are a valuable tool to communicate the most important elements of the methods and
results of a research project for a conference, manuscript, or even a research funding application. However,
abstracts may often be an overlooked part of the dissemination process. An abstract determines whether or
not a piece of research is relevant for presentation at a conference or valuable enough to be considered for
peer review and subsequent publication. A strong and clearly written abstract positively predisposes
reviewers of grant applications.
Implications for Nursing Practice: Writing an abstract is arguably the most challenging component of academic
writing, summarizing the results of a substantive research project in three to ve sentences and positioning
them concisely within the background and implications for future practice, policy, and research. A well-writ-
ten abstract is clear, concise, and critical and requires time and revision to ensure success.

Introduction
An abstract is one of the most important components of academic
writing. Although abstracts are traditionally associated with manu-
scripts or with research conferences, increasingly, abstracts are also
required for funding applications. Abstracts are a valuable tool to
communicate the most important elements of the methods and
results of a research study, yet they may receive the least time and
consideration because they are often the last component of a large
body of work.
After the signi cant undertaking of a research study, it may be dif-
cult for novice researchers to clarify the key aspects of the study
with the level of conciseness that an abstract requires. Furthermore,
those preparing abstracts for the rst time may nd themselves over-
whelmed by the diversity of guidance from different publishers and
conferences. With this in mind, we aim to provide practical guidance
to researchers for developing a comprehensible abstract, including
those required for funding applications, conferences, and publication.
What Is an Abstract?
An abstract should be a stand-alone summary of a research proj-
ect.1 Although abstracts are most used to provide an overview of a
research project, they may also be used to summarize an implemen-
tation project related to practice, policy, or education in nursing. The
abstract may be a precursor to a scienti c manuscript, chapter, thesis,
or report, or it may be the basis for an oral or poster presentation at a
conference or symposium. For a completed research study, the

abstract must summarize all key aspects of the study: how and why
the research was done and what was found;1 therefore, it can only be
written once all aspects of the research have been completed and
written up. For a grant application or research proposal, the abstract
must represent a cohesive summary of the research plan and its
potential impact. Similar to abstracts disseminating study results, an
abstract for a grant application or research proposal cannot be writ-
ten until the proposal is written and the research plan is clear.
The abstract’s most critical and obvious aim is to draw atten-
tion to a study, inviting the reader to learn more via the manu-
script or presentation. The less obvious purpose of the abstract is
to make a piece of research stand out. The audiences that
abstracts are written for may include editors, reviewers, confer-
ence attendees, or journal subscribers. Considering that the
abstract is often the most read component of a conference or
journal paper,2,3 it is critical that the abstract demonstrates the
importance of the research and its ndings. In the context of a
manuscript submitted for peer review in a scienti c journal, the
abstract is the elevator pitch that determines whether the
research should be considered for publication. In addition, a
poorly written abstract can slow down the reviewing process
because potential reviewers will decide whether or not to review
a paper based on its title and abstract.4 In the context of a confer-
ence, the abstract must provide suf cient information to demon-
strate the signi cance of the research, how it aligns with the
conference themes, and how it will add value to the conference.
The quality of the abstract also determines the reviewers’ deci-
sion on whether a submission is accepted for a conference.5
Beyond achieving the opportunity to disseminate the work
through publication or presentation, the abstract serves an important
purpose for research impact. Abstracts published as part of a peer-
reviewed publication or conference proceedings are often available
to the public, though access to the full manuscript or presentation
may be limited by subscription paywalls. Therefore, the information
communicated in the abstract may also have unintended audiences,
including members of the public, journalists, policy makers, health
care professionals, and key stakeholders with an interest in the
research topic. Where an abstract is available without further infor-
mation about the study and its results, it becomes even more impor-
tant that the abstract is accurate and representative of the research
ndings and implications to prevent misinformation or disinforma-
tion arising from how the information is interpreted.6,7
Ultimately, an abstract is often a factor in determining whether
someone will access a manuscript, attend a conference presentation,
or consider an application for funding in full.3 Researchers undertak-
ing systematic searching and screening for a literature review will
use the abstract to determine the relevance of the publication for the
review. Abstracts published as part of conference proceedings may
be searchable in academic and grey literature databases and, even if
unpublished, may have relevance for a systematic review. Policy
makers and journalists may also be other unintended audiences of an
abstract, which can increase the reach, impact, and citation of a jour-
nal article.
addressed.10 This information can be obtained from the home page of
the target conference or journal within the abstract or author guide-
lines. The context or theme of a publication or conference will often
determine the types of research that are accepted for publication or
presentation. The conference or journal home page will outline their
primary aims, objectives, and mission, and the abstract must convey
the relevance of the research to the topic and scope of the journal or
conference.6
For early career researchers who may be preparing an abstract for
the rst time, it may be of value to look at examples of abstracts from
previous conferences or issues of the target journal to understand
how they are structured, the types of information that are typically
presented in the abstract, and the tone and language used within the
abstract.8 In addition to the speci c author guidelines or abstract
guidelines for the target conference or journal, reporting guidelines
can provide useful information on the types of information that must
be reported for particular research methodologies. The majority of
reporting guidelines will also provide speci c guidance for abstract
content related to the methodology, many of which can be identi ed
via the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research
(EQUATOR) Network.11,12
What Should Be Included in an Abstract?
A good abstract is one that is clear, concise, and critical; it
needs to be informative, providing a succinct overview of how
the study was conducted, what it found, and what it means for
practice. An abstract must be critical, in that implications and
conclusions derived from the results of the study emerge logically
from the ndings and do not overestimate or underestimate the
meaning of the ndings for real-world applications.
1,3 Abstracts
are broadly structured (with speci ed headings) or unstructured.
In research contexts, the abstract will broadly include the same
information, whether structured or unstructured (Table 1). With
that said, although there are a variety of abstract types, each
journal and conference will provide speci c guidelines for the
content, length, and format of the abstract.13 Abstracts may take
alternative forms depending on the discipline, context, and topic
of research.14 However, the key messages communicated within
various forms of abstract remain consistent. Although structured
abstracts remain the predominant format for conferences and
journals related to cancer nursing, there are several alternative
abstract formats that increasingly used in cancer nursing journals
(Table 2).14 Therefore, researchers must ensure, as a rst action,
to familiarize themselves with the speci c guidelines provided by
the journal or conference.
To achieve concise communication in an abstract, planning the
key messages of the abstract is helpful. Outlining the key messages of

Preparing to Write Your Abstract
Preparation is key to success in abstract writing, and with this in
mind, ensuring adequate time to prepare, draft, and revise the manu-
script will enhance the likelihood of success. An abstract representing
a concise and targeted communication, following the guidance of the
conference or journal, will increase the chance of acceptance.8,9 Tar-
geted communication requires authors to understand the guidelines
and nuances of the target journal or conference that the abstract is
being prepared for. The author guidelines will provide insight into
the information required in the abstract, for example, the structure,
length, types of presentation, and speci c themes that must be

Abstract Type Characteristics
Highlights It is increasingly common to include the highlights of
a paper before or after the abstract. Highlights are
six or seven comments that describe what is
already known about the project and what the
results of the study reported in the paper adds to
the literature.
Lay or Public Abstracts In some cases, abstracts that are written in non-tech-
nical language are presented so the results are
understandable to a member of the public who
may not be a health care professional or a
researcher.
Tweetable abstracts Tweetable abstracts provide a concise summary of
the main point of the study in 140 characters or less
and also include a hyperlink to the study paper.
Graphical abstracts A graphical abstract is a visual representation of the
key points of a study, for example, the methods and
results of the study. While these are not a common
type of abstract, they may be a valuable way to
share the methods and key ndings of a study in a
visual format (eg, diagram/image/ gure).
Video abstracts Video abstracts usually consist of brief interviews
with the authors explaining what they did, why
they did it, and what happened. A video abstract
allows authors to present their research in a per-
sonalized media-rich environment in a manner
each section of the abstract using structured questions can be helpful
to achieve this,8,9 for example:
TITLE: What is the study/project about, and how was it achieved?
BACKGROUND: Why was this study/project needed What was
the problem?
AIM: What is this study/project about?
METHODS: What did you do?
RESULTS: What are the most important/impactful things you
found in the study/project?
CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: What does the results of your
project/study mean for patients/nurses/cancer care?
Table 3 provides an example of the process of revising a draft con-
ference abstract and identifying limitations of the rst draft to pres-
ent a high-quality abstract. As guidance for preparing each section of
the abstract is discussed, we refer to the relevant section of the
abstract presented in Table 3 to illustrate common issues that arise in
the preparation of abstracts.
Title
A title should be concise and aligned with the contents of the
abstract.16 Although titles should be designed to capture readers’
attention, they should convey the scope and design of the research in
a manner that is unambiguous, informative, and not misleading.8,13
There are usually word limits of between 10 and 15 words on
abstract or manuscript titles, and as a result, passive statements such
as “a study of . . .” should be avoided.8 Increasingly, authors are
encouraged to use a title that describes the topic and design of the
study, using the structure [study topic]: [study design]. In addition, to
ensure the abstract is searchable, the title should use standardized
keywords within the title that conform with MeSH and CINAHL index
terms.9 Reviewing the title of the rst draft abstract in Table 3, the
title of the study is descriptive and does not provide any critical infor-
mation about either the topic or design of the study. The revised title
provides a clearer statement of the objective of the study, to model
A. Drury et al. / Seminars in Oncology Nursing 39 (2023) 151395 3
health care factors in uencing quality of life in cancer survivorship,
and the study design, a mixed methods study.
Background/Introduction
The background or introduction of the study should provide a
clear and concise rationale for the study that is easy for readers who
are not experts or specialists in the topic to understand why the
study was required.16,17 This section might explain brie y what is
already known about the topic and what is not known, for example, a
statement of the problem that the study aims to address and why it
is important and necessary.6,13 Two to three sentences are generally
acceptable because readers will primarily be interested in the results
of the paper and how they were achieved.7,10,12 Unlike the main text
of an article or a presentation, references are not cited unless the
abstract guidelines state it is a requirement. Although conciseness is
important, the rst draft of the background presented in Table 3 is
exceptionally concise and does not provide adequate insight as to
why quality of life is important nor why further research is necessary
to understand quality of life. In the revised abstract, there is a clearer
statement of the context in which quality of life is examined, and the
evidence that is and is not already available to understand the impact
of health care experiences on quality of life in cancer survivorship.
Purpose/Aim
The purpose or aim of the abstract should logically follow on from
the background, and the highlighted gaps in knowledge.16 The aim
should provide a clear statement of (1) what the study set out to do,
(2) with whom (ie, the population), and (3) in what context. For those
who are less experienced in preparing a research aim statement, the
participant, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) or participant,
exposure, outcome (PEO) statement can provide all of the informa-
tion required to present a comprehensive and informative, yet con-
cise aim.18 The purpose of the draft abstract in Table 3 is vaguely
stated and does not fully represent the exposure of interest within
this study nor the population with whom the study was undertaken.
Within the revised abstract there is a clearer statement of the partici-
pants (colorectal cancer survivors up to 5 years after diagnosis),
exposure (undergoing routine follow-up care; health care-related
predictors) and outcome of interest(quality of life).
Methods
The methods section of an abstract should make it clear how a
study was conducted.7,8,13 At a minimum, the abstract should identify
the study design, setting, sampling strategy, sample size, and meth-
ods of data collection and analysis, including the questionnaires used
or broad topics of the interview schedule that guided data
collection.9,10,12,13 Abstracts that lack transparent reporting of study
methods are more likely to be rejected because it is not possible for a
reader to evaluate the rigor of the study and the trustworthiness of
the results.8 The rst draft of the methods section presented in Table 3
does not provide meaningful information about the design of the
study nor the methods which were used to capture the outcomes
investigated in this study. The revised abstract provides comprehen-
sive information about the study methods, including the speci c
study design, the setting and sample, the data collection and analysis
instruments, and the outcomes of interest within each phase of the
study.
Results
The results section is the most important section of the abstract,
providing an objective, high-level summary of the key ndings of the
study.10 The results of the study should logically link to the

Modeling Health Care Factors In uencing Quality
of Life in Cancer Survivorship: A Mixed Meth-
ods Study
Background Quality of life is important The statement does not provide insight to why
quality of life is important and does not present
suf cient information to justify why this study
was needed.
Follow-up care and quality of life (QOL) are
important consequences of cancer survivor-
ship. However, as cancer survivors transition to
follow-up care, the frequency of contact with
health care professionals declines. Evidence
suggests that the nature of posttreatment rela-
tionships between colorectal cancer (CRC) sur-
vivors, and their health care professionals is
related to survivors’ psychological well-being,
their access to supportive care services, and
experiences of unmet need. There is limited
empirical evidence to support the potential
impact of health care experiences upon CRC
survivors’ QOL, therefore . . .
Purpose/Aim This study aimed to explore Quality of life. The aim presented in this abstract is vague,
doesn’t fully re ect the variables that were
investigated in relation to quality of life
(eg, health care factors).
There are typographical errors capitalization
of quality of life.
. . . this study seeks to explore the health care-
related predictors of QOL outcomes among CRC
survivors undergoing routine follow-up care
up to 5 years after diagnosis.
Methods A study was conducted to explore qulautity
of life with people who had CRC. A
questionnaire was sent to participants.
Interviews were conducted with
participants.
The methods section does not adequately explain
how or where the study was conducted.
Unde ned abbreviations.
There are typographical error“qulautity.”
There is repetition of the aim of the study.
A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study
was conducted with CRC survivors 6-60
months after diagnosis. Participants were pur-
posefully recruited from three public and pri-
vate hospitals and 21 cancer support centers in
Ireland. A cross-sectional survey (n = 304)
assessed survivors’ QOL (EuroQOL; FACT-C),
continuity of care (PCCQ), and unmet informa-
tion and supportive care needs. Semi-struc-
tured interviews were subsequently conducted
with a subsample of survey participants
(n = 22) and analyzed thematically, eliciting
more in-depth information about survivors’
experiences of cancer-related health care and
QOL outcomes.
Results People had good quality of life. Several things
were associated with more positive QoL.
People who were interviewed also said they
had good quality of life but interacting with
hospitals was upsetting.
The results provide a very limited and unclear
explanation of the ndings.
The language used is colloquial (informal) and
inappropriate for an academic context.
There is limited relationship between some of
the ndings presented in the draft abstract and
the stated aim of the study.
Overall, CRC survivors reported positive QOL and
continuity of care. Positive QOL outcomes were
predicted by private health insurance status,
remission of disease, greater continuity of care,
nonuse of cancer support and lower levels of
social dif culty (P .05). Interview data cor-
roborated these results and identi ed a range
of individual, organizational, and political
issues that enhance understanding of the
means by which CRC survivors’ health care
experiences may in uence QOL outcomes.
Conclusion The complexity of QoL and impact of health
care on quality of life. Action from health care
professionals is needed to improve quality of
life.
The conclusions are not clearly related to the
study aim.
The recommendations are vague.
Sentences are not complete or grammatically
correct.
The results suggest that health care experiences
are predictive of QOL outcomes and may be
in uenced by survivors’ unmet information
and supportive care needs resulting from per-
ceived shortcomings in survivorship health
care. Strategies to address such unmet needs
are necessary and should consider survivors’
preferences for cancer support and social
background, aims, and methods of the abstract, in that there is con-
sistency in the population and outcomes with the methods used.12
For example, within the abstract presented in Table 3, the rst draft
of the abstract presents results related to participants’ experiences of
interacting with hospitals. However, there is no evidence within the
background, aim, or methods of the abstract that interaction with
hospitals was a focus of this study.
When writing an abstract, the results section should clearly
address the aim throughout, and each sentence within the results
should contribute to achieving the study’s aim. Vague results state-
ments should be avoided, for example“Several things were associated
with more positive QoL” (Table 3). Instead, speci c key results should
be highlighted, for example,“Positive QOL outcomes were predicted by
private health insurance status, remission of disease, greater continuity
of care, nonuse of cancer support, and lower levels of social difficulty
(p .05).” (Table 3). There is debate on the level of detail that is
needed in abstracts with respect to statistical test results, with some
authors arguing the test statistic (eg, t-value, x2 value) should be
reported within the abstract, with others suggesting a P value alone
is suf cient.1,7,13,16 The conventions regarding reporting of statistical
test results vary from discipline to discipline and even from journal
to journal within disciplines. Therefore, we recommend that the
abstract guidelines are consulted and, where speci c guidance is pro-
vided on reporting of this nature, that it is followed.
A. Drury et al. / Seminars in Oncology Nursing 39 (2023) 151395 5
Within qualitative research, whether the results section is a
descriptive statement of the research themes or a summary of the
study results again varies between disciplines and journals.10 It is
tempting to list the themes of a qualitative study or literature review
within the results section. However, at a minimum, abstracts report-
ing qualitative studies should include the central themes and add a
comprehensive description of the results in relation to the research
aim and articulate the meaning of and relationship between the
themes identi ed in a manner that makes the key results of the study
clear to the reader. Depending on how many words remain, the
authors can decide to include a list of subthemes with contextual
information.
Conclusion/Implications
The conclusion or implications section of the study should inter-
pret the meaning of the study results and provide the take home
messages and recommendations explaining what the results of the
study mean for nursing, patients, or cancer care.7 The conclusion
should not introduce any new results that have not been discussed
within the results section of the abstract and should logically follow
from the results stated within the abstract.9,12 There are a number of
issues that arise within the conclusions section of an abstract; rst, is
that this section becomes a paraphrased statement of the results sec-
tion; second, that authors over- or underestimate the meaning and
importance of the results; and third, that the abstract makes vague
recommendations for future research or practice.7-10,12 Within the
conclusions section, three sentences may be suf cient to address the
needs of this section. The rst sentence might provide a high-level
statement of what the results of the study mean in relation to the
aim based on the information presented within the results section of
the abstract. The second sentence might provide an insight as to
what this means for the intended audience or participants of the
study and in relation to practice, future research, and policy. The nal
sentence could make a recommendation as to how to address any
issues that have been identi ed within the preceding sentences.
Authorship
In general, authorship credits should follow the conventions of
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME),19
whereby all authors contribute to the work across the following four
criteria:
Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work;
or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work;
AND
Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual
content; AND
Final approval of the version to be published; AND
Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensur-
ing that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part
of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
The ordering of authors varies according to discipline, but in gen-
eral, the order re ects the level of contribution of each author, with
the exception that the mentor or senior investigator is listed last.8
The rst author is normally the person who conceives and writes the
abstract and will normally be the person who presents the abstract at
a conference or acts as the corresponding author for a manuscript.8
Final Thoughts and General Tips for Revising and Finalizing an
Abstract
Writing an abstract is arguably the most challenging com-
ponent of academic writing, summarizing the results of a
substantive research project in three to ve sentences and posi-
tioning them concisely within the background and implications
for future practice, policy, and research. It needs to be written in
a style that is clear, even to those without subject matter exper-
tise and attract the reader’s interest to know more.4 Mind map-
ping or brainstorming are helpful rst steps to put concepts onto
pages and can help authors to identify what information must be
communicated within the abstract. Getting involved in peer
review of initial drafts can also provide constructive feedback
that can help shape later iterations of the work. The rst draft of
a writing project is never the last draft; ensuring adequate time
is made available to allow self-re ection and critical editing will
help to optimize the chances of success. Redrafting is also neces-
sary to ensure the abstract’s word count is as close as possible to
any speci ed word limit outlined but not more. Furthermore,
ensuring adequate time for coauthors to provide critical feedback
will enhance the quality of the work. As seen in the rst draft
abstract in Table 3, this process of editing and proofreading is
also necessary to ensure that typographical errors and repetition
are addressed. For conferences, allowing enough time for editing
and redrafting the abstract is needed for online submission dead-
lines.
